# CMU Digital Humanities Workshop

This GitHub repository contains the materials for the Introduction to coding and Python workshop for the spring 2023 CMU Digital Humanities Workshop.

This repository organizes the materials specifically for deployment using [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). This means the actual workshop materials are located in the `contents/` directory, the rest is just boilerplate.

The `contents/` directory contains two folders. `1-Python` contains a series of eight notebooks and data files introducing the Python programming language. `2-Pandas` contains a series of seven notebooks and data files introducing the Pandas data manipulation package.
